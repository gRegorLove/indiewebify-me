# IndieWebify.me

This is an in-progress migration of the existing IndieWebify.me code from Silex to SlimPHP.

## Installation

Requirements:
* PHP 8.2

* Set the domain's document root to the `/public` directory
* Configure the server to route requests through `/public/index.php` if they donâ€™t match a file
  * If you are running Apache, do this by renaming `/public/htaccess.txt` to `/public/.htaccess`
* Run `composer install`

## Development Notes

I chose [SlimPHP Framework v4](https://www.slimframework.com/) since it feels lighter weight than alternatives like Laravel and Symfony. Slim implements several of the [PHP FIG](https://www.php-fig.org/) interop standards, which I think will make the code more portable in the future. I have developed other projects in Slim like indiebookclub.biz and some projects for work. I've found it pretty easy to work with.

For templating, I've used [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/). The previous version of indiewebify.me has some complex conditional logic in the PHP templates, so one of my goals was to split off as much of that possible into the Slim app instad of in templates. I also like the auto-escaping that Twig offers.

### App structure

I started with an MVC setup, though we don't currently have need for a database so I guess it's just VC (no no, not *that* kind).

I used [PHP-DI](https://php-di.org/) for dependency injection, which makes it easier to inject dependencies wherever they are needed.

The `/config` directory is where all the app configuration and startup happens:
- bootstrap.php: build the PHP-DI container, create an instance of the Slim app, register URL routes, and register middleware
- container.php: used for DI. This file returns an array of classes and how they're instantiated when they're injected. Not changed often, unless a custom Twig templating function needs to be added.
- middleware.php: See Slim documentation for Middleware. Not changed often.
- routes.php: Register URL routes, the methods they accept (GET, POST, etc.), and the Controller methods that handle each route.
- settings.php: returns an array of general app settings. These are commonly used in container.php

The `/src` directory has the bulk of the app code. The folders and filenames in there follow [PSR-4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) so they can be autoloaded. Currently these directories are `Controllers`, `Responder`, and `Service` since that was the design pattern I was following. Or, uh, hybrid design pattern? :) My point being, it's fine to use different naming schemes for the folders as long as it logically follows the design pattern you're using, and the classes within them use corresponding namespaces.

The `/templates` directory has the Twig templates. The `/templates/pages` contains individual page templates. I followed this blog post for setting up the template file structure: https://nystudio107.com/blog/an-effective-twig-base-templating-setup
